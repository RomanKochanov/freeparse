User-friendly text file parser with arbitrary format.

FreeParse is a flexible text parser that relies on a parsing expression grammar (PEG) approach implemented in a PyParsing library.
It uses a static XML format files, which ultimately are converted to the PyParsing expressions, to generate pythonic data structures of arbitrary complexity
consisting of nested lists and dictionaries.

In particular, FreeParse is a useful tool to process text outputs of scientific programs (this was the primary reason it has been written).
